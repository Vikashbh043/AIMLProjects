Immobilization is necessary to prevent further injury and facilitate healing, with joints proximal and distal to the injury also being immobilized. A cast or splint can be used for immobilization, depending on the severity and duration of the injury. Patients should keep the cast dry, never put an object inside it, inspect the edges and skin around the cast daily, apply lotion to any red or sore areas, pad any rough edges with soft material, seek medical care if an odor emanates from within the cast or a fever develops, and maintain good hygiene. Prolonged immobilization can cause complications such as stiffness, contractures, and muscle atrophy, particularly in the elderly. Some rapidly healing injuries may benefit from early mobilization to minimize these complications. It is important to note that for fractures, symptoms include pain, swelling, ecchymosis, crepitation, deformity, and abnormal motion, and occasional complications include fat embolism, arterial injury, compartment syndrome, nerve injuries, and infection. Diagnosis is by clinical criteria and usually plain x-rays, and treatment involves analgesics, immobilization, and sometimes surgery. Most fractures result from a single application of significant force to otherwise normal bone. Pathologic fractures result from application of mild or minimal force to a bone weakened by a disorder such as osteoporosis.'"
